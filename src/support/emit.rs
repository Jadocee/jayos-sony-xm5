//! Printing the answer.
//!
//! Every one of these programs is called by QML in the same way: run it,
//! parse stdout as JSON, ignore stderr. That makes two rules absolute.
//!
//! STDOUT IS ONLY EVER JSON. A progress line, a warning, a stray debug print --
//! any of them make `JSON.parse` throw, and the widget shows nothing with no
//! indication why. Diagnostics go to stderr.
//!
//! A FAILURE STILL PRINTS VALID JSON. The Python scripts mostly got this right
//! by accident, with a bare `print("[]")` in an except block. Getting it wrong
//! looks identical to getting it right until something fails: the widget is
//! empty either way, but one of them can say so.
//!
//! So the convention is an envelope. A list endpoint returns its list; an
//! endpoint that can fail returns `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` and the QML
//! reads `.error`. Which one each endpoint uses is fixed by its existing
//! callers, not chosen here -- these functions just make each easy to do.
