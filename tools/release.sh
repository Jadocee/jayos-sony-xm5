# Release jayos-sony-xm5: VERSION's version, as a signed tag on main, pushed.
#
#   tools/release.sh            dry run: the version, the commit, and every refusal
#   tools/release.sh --apply    the signed tag vVERSION, made, checked and pushed
#
# Run by the owner, in their checkout, on an up-to-date main, after VERSION
# says the version to release. docs/RELEASES.md is the account.
#
# Exit status: 0 tagged, or would tag; 1 refused, with the reason; 2 could
# not run -- a bad flag, no checkout, an origin that did not answer.
#
# WHAT A RELEASE IS FOR. JayOS's recipe, pkgbuilds/jayos-sony-xm5/PKGBUILD in
# that repository, builds the release it pins -- this tag, and the commit it
# names -- and JayOS's suites hold its Headphones page, its sony-daemon.sh and
# its doctor to that release's contract/ and sony-daemon-process, vendored by
# its `tools/package-release.sh jayos-sony-xm5`. The owner's call on
# 2026-11-12, "Add releases to jayos-bluetooth and jayos-sony-xm5": until then
# that recipe built whatever main held at the moment of the build (its own
# comment, "WHY A BRANCH AND NOT A COMMIT", said so and why), so two machines
# that built a day apart could hold two packages under one version, and
# JayOS's contract copy could name a commit main had moved past.
#
# A DRY RUN BY DEFAULT, like JayOS's tools/release.sh and its installers: it
# says the version and every refusal it would make, and changes nothing but
# the remote-tracking refs `git fetch` updates, which it needs to know the
# releases that exist rather than the ones this clone has seen.
#
# THE OWNER SIGNS, HERE. The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)
# holds no key: a workflow that could tag would be one that could sign as the
# owner. It checks what it is handed and publishes the release's page.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES, each before anything is tagged:
#
#   - a branch other than main, or a main that is not origin/main: what is
#     released is the commit everybody can fetch, nothing unpushed and
#     nothing behind
#   - changes to tracked files: what is tagged is the commit, and a tree that
#     differs from it is a tree nobody will get
#   - a VERSION that is not MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, one Cargo.toml's [package]
#     version does not repeat, one already released, or one not newer than
#     the newest release
#   - a commit that already carries a release
#   - a commit whose tools/check.sh does not pass, run in a worktree of the
#     commit itself, so that nothing untracked here stands in for it: there
#     is no CI on this repository, and this is the gate a release stands on
#   - signing that is not SSH, or no signing key: .github/allowed_signers is
#     ssh-keygen's format, which is what the workflow and JayOS check with
#   - an allowed_signers on origin/main with no key in it
#
# AND ONE AFTER THE TAG IS MADE: the tag is verified against origin/main's
# .github/allowed_signers, as the workflow will verify it, before it is
# pushed. A tag that fails is deleted here and never reaches GitHub.
