# What tools/release.sh and tools/publish-release.sh both need to know about a
# release: what a version and a tag look like, which of two versions is newer,
# the newest release among some tags, the keys .github/allowed_signers holds,
# and whether a tag is signed by one of them. Sourced; sets no shell options.
#
# A RELEASE IS A SIGNED TAG, vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, ON main, whose VERSION file
# says MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH -- the crate's version in Cargo.toml, which
# tests/shell/test-release.sh holds VERSION to, so the daemon's published
# `qs-<version>` and the tag cannot disagree. JayOS's recipe,
# pkgbuilds/jayos-sony-xm5/PKGBUILD there, builds the release it pins by tag
# and by commit, and vendors the same release's contract/ and
# scripts/sony-daemon-process.sh (its `tools/package-release.sh
# jayos-sony-xm5`); docs/RELEASES.md here has the whole account.
#
# The same shapes as jayos-audio's tools/lib/release.sh, which this file was
# copied from on 2026-11-12, and as JayOS's own, where a release is a signed
# tag too -- so the owner signs all three with one key and one habit. The
# version is semantic here rather than a date, since JayOS's recipe and
# contract copy say which version of this package they were written against.
